# End of Week Machine Learning Project (BlueBerry Yield Prediction)

Welcome to the end of week machine learning project! This project will be hosted on Kaggle, and the goal is to apply what you've learned throughout the week about linear regression models. 
This includes linear regression, polynomial regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic net regression.

## Project Overview
Objective: Fit a regression model to predict the target variable using the provided training data and then make predictions on the test data.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two parts:

Training Dataset: Contains features and labels.
Test Dataset: Contains features only, without labels.
You will need to prepare the data carefully, ensuring that the same data preparation steps applied to the training data are also applied to the test data.

## Data Preparation
Data preparation is a crucial step before fitting your model. Here are some key steps to consider:

- Missing Data: Handle missing values appropriately.
- Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical values if necessary.
- Scaling: Normalize or standardize your features.
- Splitting: Optionally, split your training data into training and validation sets to fine-tune your models.
- Feature Engineering: Create or transform features that might improve your model's performance.
- Ensure that these steps are consistently applied to both the training and test datasets.

## Model Training
Explore using the regression models learnt this week:

Hint: The evaluation metric for this project is Mean Absolute Error (MAE). You can use this metric during model training to fine-tune and select the best model.

## Submission
Your final submission should be a CSV file containing the test IDs and your model's predictions. The file should be structured as follows:

## Evaluation
Submissions will be evaluated based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the predicted values and the actual values.

Good luck, and happy modeling!
